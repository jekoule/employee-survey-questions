# The Joyous Employee Experience Genome
> An open sourced set of about 25 questions to measure **employee experience** (across the realms of **culture & environment**, **fairness & inclusion** and **well-being**), **employee engagement** and **eNPS**. The questions can be used in both **annual surveys** or **pulse surveys**.

## Project Goals

1. Build a single question set that can be used comparably across multiple organizations in multiple countries, eventually possibly providing benchmarking. Questions must be in plain language that is jargon free and understandable across diverse employees in diverse industries. Ensure that the questions work for "non-office-based" employees.
2. Explore a simple causal hypothesis: employee experience -> employee engagement -> business performance.
3. The question set needs to work in multiple delivery mechanisms, including via one-off complete surveys and split over frequent (weekly) delivery via pulse survey.
4. The question set should provide data both numeric scores as well as stimulate dialog and capture freeform comments.
5. Test the hypothesis that the questions themselves can positively influence employee and management behavior.
6. Utilize both the best science available in the field, as well as practical experience from HR practitioners and other people management thought leaders.

## Usage examples

The question set can be used in either a one-off complete employee survey (like an annual staff survey) or spread week by week as a pulse survey. For a one-off survey it can be populated into any popular survey tool (like Survey Monkey). For a pulse survey we recommend [Joyous](https://joyoushq.com/).
